        "My name is Charlotte, welcome to Rhetorical ragdolls, we are a very small, hobby breeder of top quality, ragdoll cats. We offer door to door delivery in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine. We also offer in cabin flights with our Currier to all areas of USA for face to face delivery.  I am a nurse and I work part time, then my hobby is ragdolls.  We chose the name rhetorical ragdolls because ragdolls have many different ways of communicating with their people, this heightened ability to communicate is one of my (many) favorite traits of the ragdoll. They are not aloof, they are very much a family member.",

We do not discriminate based on breed, age, health, or size of the animals we receive, nor do we focus on the previous family or circumstances which brought them to us. Instead, we choose to focus our energies on each animal’s future, ensuring them a safe and healthy place to grow and thrive. Because the wellbeing of our animals is paramount, we require home checks, commit to fostering until the right placement becomes available, and insist our adoptees be returned to our care should unforeseen issues arise within their new homes. That’s how deep our commitment is to providing safe, healthy, happy lives for each individual who comes into our rescue. Every life is valued. Every life is respected. Every life is loved.",

All make for great family members as this breed tends to be very calm, mellow even, and is quick to bond with humans. Very little children are very much included as ideal companions since labrador puppies adore newborn babies almost as much as their parents do.",
